## validate-json workflow

This workflow validates JSON (`*.json`) against a given schema (`*.schema.json`), provided they are in the same directory. 

### Inputs

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| src | string | A directory that contains both the `*.json` and `*.schema.json` files | false | '.' | './config' |

### Outputs

There are no explicit outputs for this workflow. 

However, it does return job failure/success based on the result of the schema validations. 

### Examples

```yaml
jobs:
  validate:
    uses: access-nri/actions/.github/workflows/validate-json@main
    with:
      src: 'config'
```

## publish-python-package workflow

This workflow builds and publishes a pure python package distribution on Pypi and Anaconda.org.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workflow only works for pure Python projects, where the built distribution is compatible with any supported Python version or architecture.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workflow sets the PyPI token, Anaconda token, and Anaconda username using the calling repository's secrets `PYPI_TOKEN`, `ANACONDA_TOKEN` and `ANACONDA_USERNAME`, respectively. 
> Make sure to define these secrets in the calling repository, and to call this workflow with `secrets: inherit`. For more details, see [Usage](#usage).

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow does not support [PyPI Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) technology, as [it cannot be used within a reusable workflow at this time](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish?tab=readme-ov-file#trusted-publishing). Therefore, a PyPI token is required to publish to PyPI.

### About
This workflow builds a Python wheel and source tarball from the projectâ€™s `pyproject.toml`, generates a conda recipe using [Grayskull](https://github.com/conda/grayskull), and builds the corresponding conda package. It then publishes the wheel to PyPI and the conda package to Anaconda.org, while also uploading an artifact containing the wheel, conda package, and tarball for further use.

### Inputs

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| pyproject-toml-dir | bool | The directory where the `pyproject.toml` file is located, relative to the repository top-level directory. | NO | `.` | `path/to/pyproject/dir` |
| pypi-package | bool | Whether to create the Python wheel and publish it to PyPI. | NO | `true` | `false` |
| conda-package | bool | Whether to create the Conda package and publish it to Anaconda.org. | NO | `true` | `false` |

### Outputs

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| artifact-name | string | The name of the artifact that gets uploaded by the workflow | `_dist_artifact` |

### Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workflow sets the PyPI token, Anaconda token, and Anaconda username using the calling repository's secrets `PYPI_TOKEN`, `ANACONDA_TOKEN` and `ANACONDA_USERNAME`, respectively.
> Make sure to define these secrets in the calling repository, and to call this workflow with `secrets: inherit`.
